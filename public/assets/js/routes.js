Oh, like when they say 'poofter' to mean 'tourist', yes. I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings?  How am I supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap? It just seems like there's still light coming in from under the door.
