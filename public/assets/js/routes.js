	description: "<p>" + "The Butler Trail is a 10 mile hike and bike trail that meanders along the bank of Ladybird Lake in downtown Austin and is considered the crown jewel of our running routes. Attracting more than 1.5 million visitors a year the trail is Austin's most popular recreational area. In this city we pride ourselves on being weird and being active, and both attributes are on full display along the trail. On a given run you are likely to see unicyclists, slack rope walkers, paddle boarders, dance walkers, and acro yogis. One of the great things about the Butler Trail is you never know what you will run across and there is always something new to discover." + "</p><p>" + "The full trail is a 10 mile loop that follows Ladybird Lake between the Mopac Bridge and Longhorn Dam passing by many of Austin’s iconic landmarks along the way, but one of the best features of the trail is that the numerous bridges allow for a loop of almost any distance, and the multiple trailheads make the trail easily accessible from anywhere in the downtown area." + "</p>"

	description: "<p>" + "This east side loop of the trail is traditionally underutilized, although with the completion of the boardwalk project in 2014 and the revitalization of Riverside Drive, there has been a significant influx of runners.  Even with the increase in usage it is still a great place to head to avoid the congestion that sometimes builds in other parts of the trail.  This route offers some of the newest additions to the trail system as well as some relics from Austin’s past.  The new Lakeshore Point Trailhead is a fantastic spot to start a run providing: ample parking along Lakeshore Drive; bathrooms; bike racks; and an outdoor workout station." + "</p><p><strong>" + "Notable Route Features: " + "</strong>" + "Along this route you will find some of the most unique urban artwork available at the trail.  You won’t want to miss the Selena memorial painted on the base of the transmission tower along Pleasant Valley, or the graffiti art and murals  decorating the walls of the old Holly Street Power Plant.  In addition to the street art, the city has also included a series of statues known as the Trail of Tejano Legends commemorating the significant musical contributions of Austin’s Tejano and Hispanic communities to the live music capital of the world." + "</p><p><strong>" + "Insider Tips: " + "</strong>" + "The Draft Pick, located in the the Amli Apartments on Lakeshore Drive, has outdoor seating and is a great place to grab a post run beer.  On a hot day, snow cones from the food trailers next door can also be a welcome treat!" + "</p>"

	description: "<p>" + "The Mopac trailhead is the most popular place to launch a run on the Butler Trail and it has a lot to offer including: large parking lots on either side of the river, clean bathrooms, public drinking fountains, plenty of space for stretching, and easy access from multiple areas of town.  The trailhead sits adjacent to Zilker Park, Austin’s playground and home to numerous events throughout the year including the Austin City Limit’s Music Festival, Blues on the Green, and the Trail of Lights.  If you are craving scenery, the Pfluger Bridge and Lou Neff Point also provide picturesque views of downtown Austin." + "</p><p><strong>" + "Notable Route Features: " + "</strong>" + "The Pfluger Pedestrian Bridge offers the first river crossing and provides the shortest loop when starting a run from the Mopac trailhead.  As such, this is the most populated area of the trail and provides the best opportunities for people watching, but it can become slightly congested with pedestrians and strollers on a crisp weekend day." + "</p><p><strong>" + "Insider Tips: " + "</strong>" + "Luke’s Locker is located just off the North side of the Pfluger Bridge and is easily accessible from the trail.  They always have an igloo full of ice cold water and a store full of anything your running heart might desire.  Ready to call it a day?  Whole Foods is a quarter mile up Lamar and has a rooftop patio that is the ideal place to open a post run bottle of wine." + "</p>"

	description: "<p>" + "This route takes you through and past some of the iconic Austin landmarks.  Head east from the mopac trailhead and for roughly the next mile you will be running along the border of Zilker Park.  Stop at Lou Neff point (where the trail makes a sharp right curve) for a spectacular view of the Austin skyline.  Continue east on the trail and pass under the Pfluger Bridge to enter Vic Mathias Shores, a sprawling urban park.  Longer term residents fondly remember this as the area Runtex used to keep stocked with ice cold jugs of water.  Times change and people move on, but the city still provides drinking fountains for runners today.  Cross the 1st Street Bridge towards downtown and begin the westerly trot back to the trailhead - this stretch will take you past Austin's most centrally located high school, Austin High, the new Heron Creek Restrooms, and the Texas Rowing Center." + "</p><p><strong>" + "Notable Route Features: " + "</strong>" + "This route takes you by one of the most photographed landmarks of Austin, the life size statute of music legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.  The bronze statute was unveiled in 1993 and was placed on this area of the trail, once called Auditorium Shores, because Stevie Ray played many concerts there.  Now renamed Vic Matthias Shores, this park is still the site of live music and festivals such as the Food and Wine Festival, the Reggae Festival, and the Urban Music Festival - all set to a backdrop of the Austin skyline." + "</p><p><strong>" + "Insider Tips: " + "</strong>" + "Vic Mathias Shores (aka Auditorium Shores to old school Austinites) is a home to a large leash free dog park with lake access.  This is a great opportunity to let your four-legged friend take a splash in the water and cool itself down." + "</p>"

During the summer months the bridge serves as home to the world's urban bat colony and if you are passing at dusk you are likely to see bats swarming from the bridge as they embark on their nightly travels (however, this is one of Austin's top tourist attractions and attracts large crowds that are not conducive to maintaining a steady pace)." + "</p><p><strong>" + "Notable Route Features: " + "</strong>" + "" + "</p><p><strong>" + "Insider Tips: " + "</strong>" + "Run this loop counter clockwise, that will have you facing North as you cross the Congress Avenue Bridge and provides a postcard view of the state Capitol building." + "</p>"

	description: "<p>" + "I-35 provides the last turnaround point before you are invested in running the full loop.  This is a fun route to study the anthropological behavior of trail users.  Each loop, while being part of the same trail and relatively close together, has it's own personality and attracts it's own set of users.  The farther you go, the more fun it is to analyze who is using the trail at each juncture and what brings them to that particular spot." + "</p><p><strong>" + "Notable Route Features: " + "</strong>" + "This route includes a long stretch of the boardwalk.  This boardwalk was completed in 2014 and provided a much needed service to local runners by closing a 1.3 mile gap in the trail.  Prior to completion, runners were forced onto a narrow sidewalk along a busy road, had to climb the steep hill at Riverside Drive, and scamper across I-35 to meet back up with the trail.  Local trail runners are very grateful for the boardwalk and never miss an opportunity to thank the Trail Foundation who played an instrunmental role in bringing the boardwak to life." + "</p><p><strong>" + "Insider Tips: " + "</strong>" + "The row center along this route is home to Alta's Coffee and Wine, the only coffeshop directly on the trail.  They also have indoor bathrooms that are open to the public." + "</p>"
