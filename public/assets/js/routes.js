	description: "<p>" + "The Butler Trail is a 10 mile hike and bike trail that meanders along the bank of Ladybird Lake in downtown Austin and is considered the crown jewel of our running routes. Attracting more than 1.5 million visitors a year the trail is Austin's most popular recreational area. In this city we pride ourselves on being weird and being active, and both attributes are on full display along the trail. On a given run you are likely to see unicyclist, slack rope walkers, paddle boarders, dance walkers, and acro yogis. One of the great things about the Butler Trail is you never know what you will run across and there is always something new to discover." + "</p><p>" + "The full trail is a 10 mile loop that follows Ladybird Lake between the Mopac Bridge and Longhorn Dam passing by many of Austin’s iconic landmarks along the way, but one of the best features of the trail is that the numerous bridges allow for a loop of almost any distance, and the multiple trailheads make the trail easily accessible from anywhere in the downtown area." + "</p>"

	description: "<p>" + "This east side loop of the trail is traditionally underutilized, although with the completion of the boardwalk project in 2014 and the revitalization of Riverside Drive there has been a significant influx of runners in recent years.  Even with the increase in usage it is still a great place to head to avoid the congestion that sometimes builds in other parts of the trail.  This route offers some of the newest additions to the trail system as well as some relics from Austin’s past.  The new Lakeshore Point Trailhead is a fantastic spot to start a run providing: ample parking along Lakeshore Drive; bathrooms; bike racks; and an outdoor workout station." + "</p><p><strong>" + "Notable Route Features: " + "</strong>" + "Along this route you will find some of the most unique urban artwork available at the trail.  You won’t want to miss the Selena memorial painted on the base of the transmission tower along Pleasant Valley, or the graffiti art and murals  decorating the walls of the old Holly Street Power Plant.  In addition to the street art, the city has also included a series of statues known as the Trail of Tejano Legends commemorating the significant musical contributions of Austin’s Tejano and Hispanic communities to the live music capital of the world." + "</p><p><strong>" + "Insider Tips: " + "</strong>" + "The Draft Pick, located in the the Amli Apartments on Lakeshore Drive, has outdoor seating and is a great place to grab a post run beer.  On a hot day, snow cones from the food trailers next door can also be a welcome treat!" + "</p>"

The Thom’s Market across the street also offers a wide variety of rehydrating beverages and a full array of sandwiches and snacks." + "</p>"

	description: "<p>" + "The Mopac trailhead is the most popular place to launch a run on the Butler Trail and it has a lot to offer including: large parking lots on either side of the river, clean bathrooms, public drinking fountains, plenty of space for stretching, and easy access from multiple areas of town.  The trailhead sits adjacent to Zilker park, Austin’s playground and home to numerous events throughout the year including the Austin City Limit’s Music Festival, Blues on the Green, and the Trail of Lights.  If you are craving scenery, the Pfluger Bridge and Lou Neff Point also provide picturesque views of downtown Austin." + "</p><p><strong>" + "Notable Route Features: " + "</strong>" + "The Pfluger Pedestrian Bridge offers the first river crossing and provides the shortest loop when starting a run from the Mopac trailhead.  As such, this is the most populated area of the trail and provides the best opportunities for people watching, but it can become slightly congested with pedestrians and strollers on a crisp weekend day." + "</p><p><strong>" + "Insider Tips: " + "</strong>" + "Luke’s Locker is located just off the North side of the Pfluger bridge and is easily accessible from the trail.  They always have an igloo full of ice cold water and a store full of anything your running heart might desire.  Ready to call it a day?  Whole Foods is a quarter mile up Lamar and has a rooftop patio that is the ideal place to open a post run bottle of wine." + "</p>"

The bronze statute was unveiled in 1993 and was placed on this area of the trail, once called Auditorium Shores, because Stevie Ray played many concerts there.  Now renamed Vic Matthias Shores, this park is still the site of live music and festivals such as the Food and Wine Festival and the Reggae Festival all set to a backdrop of the Austin skyline." + "</p><p><strong>" + "Insider Tips: " + "</strong>" + "Vic Mathias shores (previously knows as Auditorium Shores) is a home to a large leash free dog park with lake access.  This is a great opportunity to let your four legged friend take a splash in the water and cool itself down." + "</p>"
